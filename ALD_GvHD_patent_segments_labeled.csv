One of the advantages of the hyperimmunized egg product is that it would have a higher aad more consistent level of antibodies (e.g. IgY antibodies) to Aidterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecalis cytolysin toxin compared to a control ege product or an egg product from a chicken that has been immunized with Enterococcus faecium, Enierocoecus faecalis or Enterococcus faecatis cytolysin toxin using standard immunization techniques.

Typically standard immunization consists of an initial immunization followed by one or two booster immunization at 30 day intervals. In some embodiments. hyperimmunization comprises at least 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or 10 immunizations with Evterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis and/or Enterococcus faecalis cytolysin toxin as described heretn.

The hyperimmunized egg product can be produced by any egg-producing animal. It is preferred that the animal be a member of the class Aves ot, in other words, an avian.

For example, itis generally known in the art that Ig ¥ antibody is found in egg  yolks. Accordingly, those having ordinary skill in the art would clearly recognize that separation of egg yoiks could provide more potent factions or elimination of undesirable components, and would allow for other modes of administration such as administering hvperimmunized egg product parenterally, subcutaneously, iitravenously, intramuscularly, intrapenitoneally,  intranasally, orally or topically. Such further separation will provide for the ability to make  encapsulated products and compositions cornprising said egg or fraction thereof.  The hyperimmune egg product is preferably administered to the subject in an amount that is immunologically effective in treating or preventing alcoholic liver disease or GVHD. Dosage  and duration of the administration will depend upon the particular condition of the subject.
