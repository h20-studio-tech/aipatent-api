DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides methods for treating diseases.

In certain aspects, the disclosure relates to a method for preventing or treating graft-versus-host disease in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a hyperimmunized egg product.

Furthermore, the methods can be combined with other treatments.

In certain embodiments, the hyperimmunized egg product comprises antibodies specific to Enterococcus faecalis.

Additional details follow.
