    "text": "DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION\n1. Definitions\nAs used herein, the singular forms \"a\", \"an\" and \"the\" are intended to include the\nplural forms as well, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.\n5 As used herein, \u201cabout\u201d is a term of approximation and is intended to include minor\nvariations in the literally stated amounts, as would be understood by those skilled in the art.\nSuch variations include, for example, standard deviations associated with techniques\ncommonly used to measure the amounts of the constituent elements or components of an alloy\nor composite material, or other properties and characteristics. All of the values characterized\n10 by the above-described modifier \"about,\" are also intended to include the exact numerical\nvalues disclosed herein. Moreover, all ranges include the upper and lower limits.\nAny compositions described herein are intended to encompass compositions which\nconsist of, consist essentially of, as well as comprise, the various constituents identified\nherein, unless explicitly indicated to the contrary.\n15 As used herein, the recitation of a numerical range for a variable is intended to convey\nthat the variable can be equal to any value(s) within that range, as well as any and all sub-\nranges encompassed by the broader range. Thus, the variable can be equal to any integer\nvalue or values within the numerical range, including the end-points of the range. As an\nexample, a variable which is described as having values between 0 and 10, can be 0, 4, 2-6,\n20 2.75, 3.3 - 4.4, etc.\nIn the specification and claims, the singular forms include plural referents unless the\ncontext clearly dictates otherwise. As used herein, unless specifically indicated otherwise, the\nword \"or\" is used in the \"inclusive\" sense of \"and/or\" and not the \"exclusive\" sense of\n\"either/or.\"\n25 Unless indicated otherwise, each of the individual features or embodiments of the\npresent specification are combinable with any other individual feature or embodiment that are\ndescribed herein, without limitation. Such combinations are specifically contemplated as\nbeing within the scope of the present invention, regardless of whether they are explicitly\ndescribed as a combination herein.\n- 9 -",

Transdermally can include\nsystemic delivery (i.e., where the active ingredient is transported across, or substantially\nthrough, the dermis such that the active ingredient is delivery into the bloodstream and\nsystemically), as well as intradermal delivery (i.e., where the active ingredient is transported\npartially through the dermis, e.g., across the outer layer (stratum corneum) of the skin, where\nthe active ingredient is delivered into the skin. That is, transdermal delivery as used herein\nincludes delivery of an active ingredient that is transported across at least a portion of skin.\nAs used herein, an \u201cactive ingredient\u201d refers to a molecule for treating a disease state,\nand includes small molecules, and macromolecules such as proteins, e.g., immunoglobulins,\nsuch as IgG and IgY, DNA, and RNA.\nAs used herein, a \u201cdrug\u201d refers to an active ingredient.\nAs used herein, a \u201cmatrix\u201d refers to a material in which something is enclosed or\nembedded.\nAs used herein, the term \u201chyperimmunization\u201d means repeated exposure to one or\nmore antigens such that an immune response is elevated and maintained above the natural\nunexposed state.",
