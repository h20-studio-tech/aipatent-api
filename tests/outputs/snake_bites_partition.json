    "text": "TRANSDERMAL ADMINISTRATION OF ANTIBODIES FOR TREATMENT OF\nSNAKE BITES AND OTHER VENOMOUS OR INFECTIOUS BITES\nRELATED APPLICATION\nThis application is filed as a Provisional Application with the Indian Patent Office.\n5 FIELD OF INVENTION\nThe present invention is related to a transdermal patch and the process of developing\ntransdermal administration of a drug that is antibodies or small molecules, for the treatment of\nsnake bites and other venomous or infectious bites. The topical application of drug or\nantibody formulations is through transdermal patches containing a microneedle array\n10 provided with either IgG based anti-snake venoms or IgY based anti-snake venoms or IgG or\nIgY antibodies to any protein or antigen alone or in combination with peptide(s) or small\nmolecule(s) (synthetic/natural), aimed to treat venomous or infectious bites in humans as well\nas animals.\nBACKGROUND\n15 Snakebite is one of the major public health concerns across the globe. As per WHO\n2020, more than 100,000 deaths are reported every year and more than 400,000 people suffer\nfrom morbidity due to snakebite alone, globally. Snakebite being one of the most neglected\ntropical diseases, rural population living in tropical areas is the most affected one by\nsnakebite, where the anti-snake venoms are not available due to limitations in the logistics and\n20 cold chain maintenance. Early administration of antivenins is the only way to success in the\nsnakebite treatment without any local tissue damage or amputations.\nEnvenomation due to snake bites is one of the neglected tropical diseases, though it is\nassociated with huge mortality and morbidity every year globally. According to WHO, India\nreports highest deaths of snakebite annually compared to other nations. For example, the\n25 World Health Organization reports the Indian subcontinent was drastically affected by snake\nenvenoming with the highest mortality of an average of 58,000 annual deaths worldwide\nestimated from 2000- 2019 [WHO, Departmental News, October 2020]. Snake envenoming\nas a life-threatening disease is a major public health problem globally for which immediate\n- 2 -",

The local toxicity of Cobra (Elapidae) bite associated\nwith tissue damage accompanied by several acute pathological alterations leading to\ndetrimental effects like tissue loss sequel, long-lasting physical disability and tissue damage,\nand dermo-necrosis depending on the quantity of venom injected and time taken for\n5 antivenom administration [Lin et al., Toxins 14, 111 2022].\nThe conventional treatment methods of envenomation include field management like\nusage of tourniquet, compression of the wound, primary wound suction, and incision, and\napplication of herbal medicine. However, these first-aid techniques are not recommended\nbecause of poor outcomes [Juckett & Hancox, Am Fam Physician 65(7): 1367-1374 (2002);\n10 Alberts et al., Toxicology 43(2): P181-P186 (2004)]. Envenomation by scorpions, spiders,\nand jellyfish also can cause local and systemic toxicity, neurotoxicity and necrotic ulcers.\nAdministration of anti-venom or antivenin is the mainstay treatment for\nenvenomation. Such antivenins are manufactured by venom-immunization of equines,\ntypically horses, or immunization of ovines, such as sheep. Antivenins mainly consist of\n15 purified Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies that neutralize the venom. These antibodies may\nbe polyclonal or monoclonal. Polyclonal antibodies are effective against wide a range of\nvenoms. Monoclonal antibodies are targeted to the venom of a single toxin [O'Leary &\nIsbister, Toxicon 54(2): 192-195 (2009)]. Some antivenoms can exhibit poor dose efficacy,\nand may cause severe side effects like anaphylaxis and serum sickness in some subjects.\n20 Available recombinant antivenins can cause fewer adverse reactions than the tradition\nversions, and can be more potent, paraspecific, and can be manufactured at a lower cost\ncompared to the traditional methods of producing antivenoms [Jenkins & Laustsen, Frontiers\nin Bioengineering and Biotechnology Vol. 8, Article 703 (2020)].\nAt present, anti-snake venoms and other anti-venoms typically are given by\n25 intravenous (i.v) administration only. Among the limitations with the current treatment\noptions are:\n1. Treating the bite victim can require a hospital admission and administration of\nthe treatment by a medically trainer professional.\n- 3 -",

Due to limitations in logistics, and the distance between the location of the bite\noccurring and a medical facility, it can take a few hours to days for the bite\nvictim to reach a facility where the treatment can be administered.\n3. While anti-snake venoms may be available in Primary Health Centres (PHCs)\n5 in bite prone geographical areas, the reliability can be reduced due to storage\nissues and difficulties in cold chain maintenance.\n4. Any delay in anti-venom administration can cause severe and irreversible local\ntissue damage at the bitten area, especially in the case of venomous snakes.\n5. At present, the available treatment and route of administration can neutralize\n10 only the systemic toxicity of a venom but cannot reverse the necrosis caused at\nthe bitten area.\nThese limitations are not just restricted to snake-bites, but are applicable to any other\nvenomous bites including bites caused by scorpions, spiders, honeybee, jellyfish, cone snails,\nand venomous fish, such as lionfish, scorpionfish, and stonefish.\n15 Accordingly, a need exists for a remedy that can be applied readily to a bitten area of a\nsubject by an untrained person immediately or soon after envenomation specifically to\nprevent local toxicity of venom as well as to prevent or minimize further entry of venom into\nthe circulation system.\nRabies is recognized as one of the global leading causes of death due to infection\n20 (Rabies and Envenoming: A Neglected Public Health Issue, Report of a Consultative Meeting,\nWorld Health Organization, Geneva, 2007). While dog bites are the primary vehicle of\ntransmission, rabies can be present in other domestic as well as wild animals, and can be\nspread by bites from these animals as well. If untreated, rabies is fatal. While vaccines\nagainst rabies are available in developed countries, they are not readily available to the most\n25 vulnerable populations (Rabies Fact Sheet, World Health Organization, May 2021). For\neffective treatment, an approved effective rabies vaccine or rabies immunoglobulin needs to\nbe administered as quickly as possible following suspected infection in order to minimize\nvirus mobility or to prevent virus penetration into the subject\u2019s central nervous system.

    "text": "addition to rabies, dog bites can cause infection by staphylococcus bacteria, streptococcus\nbacteria, Pasteurella multocida or Pasteurella canis.\nAccordingly, a need exists for a remedy that can be applied readily by an untrained\nperson immediately or soon after a bite or scratch from an animal, especially if the animal is\n5 suspected to have or have been exposed to rabies, of if the wound is contaminated by saliva\nfrom the animal, specifically to minimize migration of the virus as well as to prevent or\nminimize entry of the rabies virus into the circulation system and/or central nervous system.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nThe present innovation focuses on a novel scientific technology to treat venomous\n10 bites, poisonous bites, and animal bites through a modern transdermal drug delivery system\n(TDDS). Antivenins mainly consist of IgG or IgY antibodies against four poisonous snakes\nviz., Naja Naja (Cobra), Bungarus Caeruleus (common Krait), Daboia russelii (Russell\u2019s\nviper) and Echis carinatus (Saw-scaled viper). These antibodies are commercially produced\nfrom hyper-immunized horse plasma or chicken eggs by injecting different venoms or\n15 antigens along with suitable adjuvants. After establishing the efficacy and safety of these\nantibody preparations, they can be used in suitable formulations as transdermal patches or\nointments or lotions or gels to be applied on local bitten area. Proposed innovation of\ntransdermal patch mediated delivery of anti-snake venoms and other antibodies to the target\nvenom or microbe at bitten areas can have significant impact on reducing the local tissue\n20 damage or amputations caused by snakebites or other venomous bites and thereby prolongs\nthe survival time of the victim.\nThe present invention provides a first-aid and compliments the existing method of\ntreating bites by venomous and non-venomous animals and insects. Usage of drug (antivenin,\nsmall molecules etc.) loaded transdermal patches can help in prolonging the survival time\n25 before victims reach a hospital or medical facility, and also can help in avoiding amputations\nor morbidity caused due to venomous and infectious bites and in so doing can help in\nimproving quality of life in human beings as well as animals that are victims to bites by\nvenomous and non-venomous animals and insects across the globe.\n- 5 -",

    "text": "In some configurations, the transdermal patches provided herein can be formulated to\ntreat canine bites, such as to prevent rabies, or infections caused by staphylococcus bacteria,\nstreptococcus bacteria, Pasteurella multocida or Pasteurella canis.\nThe present invention provides a transdermal patch loaded with IgG or IgY or\n5 phytochemical based polyclonal anti-snake venoms against four major venomous snakes\nwhich include but not limited to common Cobra, common Krait, Russell\u2019s viper and Saw-\nscaled viper. This transdermal patch loaded with the drug is used as a first aid in the\nsnakebite treatments and prevents systemic circulation of venom toxins thus helping in saving\nlives of victims. The patch is designed to release the anti-snake venoms into the skin/muscle\n10 primarily and allows them to neutralize the free venom toxins at the bitten area. These\nantibodies are of IgG or IgY based raised in horse or chickens/avians respectively. Horse or\nchicken/avian are immunized with sub-lethal doses of either individual or cocktail of four\nmajor snake venoms or venom peptides along with suitable adjuvants to improve the immune\nresponse in the animals. Further these high tier antibodies may be purified from immunized\n15 horse plasma (IgG antibodies, FIG. 2) or from eggs of immunized chickens/avians (IgY\nantibodies, FIG. 3). Further, these purified antibodies can be formulated to ensure the\nsuitability to load into the transdermal patches for easy/sustained release of antibodies into the\nlocal tissue at bitten site.\nIn addition to antibodies, the transdermal patch may also include small molecule\n20 drugs, antibiotics, a combination of drugs such as, for example, antivenom peptide and a\nsmall molecule, or combinations thereof as appropriate.\nThe transdermal patches provided herein can be used for immediate administration of\nan active ingredient, such as an antivenin, to a bite site. The immediate administration can\nsave victims of bites and minimize or prevent local tissue damage. In some configurations,\n25 the transdermal patches provided herein can allow an active ingredient to permeate the\napplication site and enter into the bloodstream within 5 minutes of application. This helps in\nneutralizing the circulating venoms or toxins, thereby lowering venom or toxin induced\ntoxicity. The rapid release of the active ingredient, such as an antivenin, at the bite site also\ncan minimize local tissue damage that otherwise would have been caused by the venom or\n30 toxin.\n- 6 -",

Transdermal Delivery\nTransdermal drug delivery system (TDDS) is a self-contained drug loaded system\nwhich delivers drug(s) in reproducible or predetermined rate via skin portal into systemic\ncirculation that last for long time [Prabhakar et al., Journal of Drug Delivery & Therapeutics\n5 3(4): 213-221 (2013)]. Since the first Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of\nTransderm-Scop a scopolamine transdermal patch in 1981, the transdermal delivery market\nshare increased from $12.7 billion to $31.5 billion in the year of 2005 to 2015. Today, more\nthan 35 transdermal products have been approved by USA for several diseases including\ntransdermal patches containing drugs against central nervous system disorders and patches for\n10 treatment against Parkinson\u2019s (Neupro\u00ae (2007)), Alzheimer\u2019s ((Exelon\u00ae (2007)), depression\n((Emsam\u00ae (2006)), and deficit hypersensitivity reactions (Daytrana\u00ae (2006)) [Singh and\nBali, Journal of Analytical Science and Technology 7: 25 (2016); Isaac et al., Therapeutic\nAdvances in Psychopharmacology 2(6): 255-263 (2012)].\nWhile transdermal and topical drug delivery can be used for therapeutic treatment for\n15 delivery of some efficacious molecules, the barrier properties of skin can limit the size of the\nmolecules that can penetrate the outermost skin layers, such as the stratum corneum.\nTypically, only drugs having a low molecular weight, low meting point with high lipophilicity\ncan easily permeate the skin. Thus, many drug molecules do not cross barriers of the skin,\nparticularly the stratum corneum barrier.\n20 To improve permeability, and thus enhance the drug delivery, techniques such as\nablation, sonophoresis, iontophoresis, or a combination thereof, have been used. These\napproaches typically require special equipment to be effective. Chemical permeation\nenhancers to increase the permeability or porosity of the outermost skin layers have also been\ndeveloped. Typically, these chemicals interact with one or more skin constituents of the\n25 stratum corneum to increase its permeability These can include alcohols, amines, amides,\nceramides, esters, fatty acids, glycols, hydrocarbons, lipids, pyrrolidines, sulfoxides,\nsurfactants, terpenes, ureas, and combinations thereof. The mechanism of action and\nexamples of specific types of chemical permeation enhancers for transdermal drug delivery\nare known in the art (e.g., see Chen et al., Asia Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 9: 51-64\n30 (2014); and Karande et al., Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1788: 2362-2373 (2009)).\n- 13 -",

The active ingredient can be an IgG or\nIgY antibody, an antibiotic, a chemical permeation enhancer, or any combination thereof.\n15 When the patch is applied, and light pressure is applied to the transdermal patch, the\nmicroneedle array can puncture the outer layer of the skin, delivering the one or more than\none active ingredient through the stratum corneum.\n3. Components of Transdermal Patch\nThe transdermal patch provided herein is a multilaminate design that can include, but\n20 is not limited to components including a release liner, microneedle array, a drug matrix, and a\nbacking. Together, these components help in maintaining the stability of the transdermal\npatch, and can result in the rapid diffusion of active ingredients into the skin without losing\nthe efficacy of the active ingredients loaded into the patch.\nExemplary configurations of the transdermal patch provided herein are shown in FIG.\n25 1A through FIG. 1C. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1A, the transdermal patch 1000\nincludes a release liner 100, an adhesive layer 200, a microneedle array layer 300, and a\nbacking layer 400.

For\nexample, solution of anti-venom IgG or IgY antibodies can be placed into the hollows of the\nmicroneedles. In some embodiments, the microneedle array containing the solution of the\n5 antibodies can be lyophilized to produce a lyophilized anti-venom IgG or IgY material within\nthe hollows of the microneedles. In some embodiments, the solution of anti-venom IgG or\nIgY antibodies can include a bioerodable or biodegradable gelling agent that can set to form a\nsolid or semi-solid gel within the hollows of the microneedles. Once the microneedle array\npunctures the stratum corneum, skin interstitial fluid can dissolve or help to release the anti-\n10 venom IgG or IgY antibodies from within the microneedles. Exemplary bioerodable or\nbiodegradable gelling agents include chitin, alginate, gellan gum, polylactic acid (PLA),\npolyglycolic acid (PGA), poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide), polycaprolactone, poly(amides),\npoly(ester amides), polyhydroxy acids, polyalkanoates, and combinations thereof.\n2. Drug-loaded Adhesive Matrix\n15 In some embodiments, the active ingredient can be included in an adhesive matrix.\nThe adhesive matrix can be in fluid communication with the microneedle array. When the\nmicroneedle array punctures the stratum corneum, skin interstitial fluid can flow through the\nmicroneedles forming a fluid conduit which allows active ingredient within the adhesive\nmatrix to dissolve and flow back past the stratum corneum and into the lower epidermis\n20 and/or the dermis. The active ingredient can be mixed with an adhesive material to form the\nadhesive matrix. For example, a lyophilized form of IgG or IgY anti-venom or anti-toxin\nantibody and be dispersed into an adhesive material to form the drug loaded adhesive matrix.\nMicronized or encapsulated lyophilized antibody also can be dispersed throughout the\nadhesive material to produce the drug-loaded adhesive matrix. Precipitated IgG or IgY anti-\n25 venom or anti-toxin antibody also can be dispersed throughout the adhesive material to\nproduce the drug-loaded adhesive matrix.

Methods of encapsulating\nantibodies and other proteins are known in the art and are described, for example, in U.S. Pat.\n5 No. 7,105,158 (D\u2019Souza et al., 2006). Materials that are biodegradable and nonantigenic can\nbe used as the encapsulating material. Encapsulating materials include, but are not limited to,\nalbumin, poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid), globulin, natural and synthetic polymers, and\nthermoplastic polymers. Any polymer that is biocompatible and bioerodible can be used for\nencapsulation. A number of available crosslinking agents such as glutaraldehyde can be used\n10 to crosslink the encapsulating material. Additionally, the degree of crosslinking used to form\nthe encapsulated active ingredient can be varied by using different concentrations crosslinking\nagent whereby the resulting encapsulated materials can exhibit different release rates, thereby\ncreating a prolonged continuous release of the active ingredient.\nIn another embodiment, the active ingredient can be provided in the form of solid\n15 particles adhered to the surface of the adhesive. In particular, these particles may be\nhydrophilic, so that contact with aqueous fluid exposed at the surface of the treated skin, such\nas skin interstitial fluid, will cause the particles to dissolve or disintegrate, thus releasing the\nactive ingredient into the skin.\nAny adhesive material that causes little or no irritation or sensitization of the skin\n20 during the intended period for which the transdermal patch is to be used can be selected for\nformation of the drug-loaded adhesive matrix. Examples of suitable adhesives include\nacrylates, silicones, polyisobutylenes, synthetic rubber, natural rubber, and copolymers and\nmixtures thereof.

In the\n15 methods, the level of antibodies to the antigen in the hyperimmunized egg is increased\nrelative to an egg from an animal that has not been hyperimmunized.\nUse of avian antibodies (IgY) further increases the number of antigenic epitopes of\ntoxins available to target, due to avian species\u2019 phylogenetic distance from mammalian-\nderived proteins and proteins of mammalian pathogens. The polyclonal nature of the avian\n20 antibodies for multiple epitopes for neutralization or target toxin/antigen translates to\nimproved efficacy, particularly when compared to monoclonal antibodies.\nEgg-producing animals produce antibodies in blood and eggs that are specific to\nparticular immunogens.
