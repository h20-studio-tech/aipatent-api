DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides methods and compositions for treating various diseases.

In certain aspects, the disclosure relates to a method for preventing or treating graft-versus-host disease in a subject in need thereof, comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of a hyperimmunized egg product.

Furthermore, the methods can be combined with standard treatments.

In certain embodiments, the hyperimmunized egg product comprises antibodies specific to Enterococcus faecalis.

In some embodiments, the effective amount is between 100 mg and 1000 mg per day.

Additional details are provided below.
