"Embodiment: A method for extracting, purifying, and characterizing IgY antibodies from hyperimmunized chicken egg yolks. In this embodiment, NaCl is adjusted to pH 4 and added to the egg yolk extract, allowing precipitation for 2 hours. The precipitate is then separated via centrifugation, and excess salt is removed by dialysis in PBS. Total IgY is quantified by measuring the absorption at 280 nm using a NanoDrop™ One Microvolume UV-Vis Spectrophotometer, and the purity of the IgY is analyzed by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions. In addition, antibody specificity and titers are determined by ELISA. For example, to assess the anti-E. faecalis antibody titer, a 96-well plate is coated with 1 mg/mL of E. faecalis lysate in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.3) and incubated overnight at 4°C, followed by blocking with 1% BSA in PBS, treatment with serially diluted primary antibodies, incubation with a goat anti-chicken HRP secondary antibody, and development of the signal using TMB substrate with the reaction stopped by HCl and measurement at 450 nm. A similar procedure is applied to determine the anti-cytolysin antibody titer by coating a plate with 0.5 mg/mL cytolysin. Furthermore, the neutralization ability of IgY is evaluated by culturing Enterococcus faecalis to a defined optical density, diluting the culture, and treating it with antibodies at 15 mg/mL. After incubation, serial dilutions of the culture are plated, incubated for colony formation, and the inhibition of bacterial colony formation is quantified by counting the colonies. In summary, this embodiment discloses methods for the extraction, purification, characterization, and functional evaluation of IgY antibodies from hyperimmunized chicken egg yolks.",ALD_GvHD_provisional_patent.pdf,31
"Evaluation of Target Specific Antibody Titer

Specific activity of IgY antibody against F. faecalis and cytolysin antigens was measured by indirect ELISA. ELISA results indicated positive binding of IgY to the specific antigens when compared to the control IgY with a high titer of 1:32,000. See Figures 3A and 3B.

Target Neutralization and Evaluation

Growth inhibitory effects of IgY antibodies on F. faecalis were investigated. Whole cell E. faecalis bacteria were incubated with 15 mg/ml of IgY, and cfu analysis was performed after 24 h incubation. Treatment with 15 mg/ml IgY inhibited by >70% the growth of E. faecalis as visualized by a reduction in the number of colonies on the agar plate. See Figure 4.

The growth inhibitory effect of IgY on E. faecalis was quantitated, and the percent inhibition was plotted. Treatment of E. faecalis with an anti-E. faecalis+cytolysin IgY antibody at 15 mg/ml concentration resulted in 75% inhibition of E. faecalis growth, indicating successful generation of neutralizing antibodies. See Figure 5.",ALD_GvHD_provisional_patent.pdf,32

Methods

Preparation of Egg Powder for Preclinical Studies

Egg whites and yolks were homogenized and freeze dried to create an egg powder. The egg powder was stored at 4°C. The freeze-dried egg powder was analyzed for antibody activity as described above in Example 1, and then evaluated in the humanized model of alcoholic liver disease (ALD).

Stool samples from cytolysin-positive human patients with alcoholic hepatitis were used for fecal transplantation in germ-free mice. Mice were gavaged with 100 µl of stool samples (1 g stool dissolved in 30 ml Luria-Bertani (LB) medium containing 15% glycerol under anaerobic conditions), starting at an age of 5-6 weeks and repeated two weeks later. Two weeks after the second gavage, mice were placed on the ethanol or control (isocaloric) diet as described by Duan et al, 2019, Nature 575: 505-531.

"Embodiment: A method for evaluating and potentially treating liver pathology associated with alcoholic liver disease is disclosed. In this embodiment, male and female CS7BL/6 germ-free mice are used. The mice are first bred, and then, at the age of 3–6 weeks, are subjected to a fecal transplantation using stool samples from an enterolysin‐positive human patient with alcoholic hepatitis, with a repeat transplantation 2 weeks later. The mice are fed a Lieber-DeCarli diet where the caloric intake is set at 0% ethanol on days 1–5 and increased to 36% from day 6 until the study’s end. At day 16, a single dose of ethanol (5 μl per kg body weight) is administered via gavage in the early morning, with the animals being sacrificed 9 hours later. Paired control mice receive an isocaloric substitution of dextrose in their diet. In conjunction with these treatments, Ege powder is added to the liquid diet at the start of ethanol administration. The Ege powder comprises either a control IgY derived from eggs of non-immunized hens or an anti-E. fascolistanti‐cytolysin IgY, administered at daily dosages of 1, 5, or 13 mg. The liquid diet, which contains fats, carbohydrates, proteins, and either ethanol or isocaloric dextrose, is replaced every third day.
