"Methods

Preparation of Hyperimmune Ege Powder

Two (2) ra of primary culture of Maieracoccus faecalis was initiated from glycerol stocks. A large batch of culture was developed by inoculating with the primary culture at 0.2% in a 500 mL culture bottle and grown overnight at 37°C with shaking at 180 rpm. Bacteria were pelleted by centrifugation at 6000 rpm at 4°C. The pellet was washed once with ice cold PBS. The pellet was again resuspended in ice cold PBS, transferred into a glass tube and was sonicated for 10 cycles at the highest setting for 30 minutes each cycle. The resulting lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm at 4°C for 15 min and the supernatant was collected. Total protein was quantified by BCA protein assay.

Preparation of recombinant cytolysi

Pure recombinant £. jaecalis cytolysin toxin was prepared by Genscript USA, Piscataway, NJ.

Llyperimmunization protocol

A mixture of F. faecalis bacterial lysate and E. faecalis cytolysin toxin were diluted to 2me/mL and | mg/ml in PBS, tespectively, and were used as the moculum. Separate chickens were immunized with each of the antigens using a 1:1 mixture of the inoculum and Freund’s complete adjuvant.

Immunizations were performed at 0, 4, 7, 14 and 28 days and egys were collected.

Extraction of Antibody for Evaluation of Titer and Neutralization

IgY antibody was extracted from hyperrmmunized eggs using a water dilution method. 100 wL of the yolk was diluted in 10 ml of water, mixed thoroughly, and centrifuged to pellet the lipids while the antibodies and other soluble egg proteins were extracted into the water phase. The water phase was used to evaluate titer determination by ELISA as described below.

For neutralization assays, lgY was extracted from hyperimmunized egg yolks by water dilution and a NaCl precipitation method. Four to five egg yolks were diluted at 1:10 ratio with water acidified to pH 5 using 0.5 M HCI and frozen overnight. Diluted egg voik was thawed at 37°C and centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 20 min to separate the lipids. The supernatant was filtered and mixed with 8.8%

"Evaluation of Target Snecitic Antibody Titer

Specific activity of IgY antibody against £. faecalis and cytolysin antigens was measured by indirect ELISA. ELISA results indicated positive binding of IgY to the specific antigens when compared to the control I¢¥ with a high titer of 1:32,000. See Figures 3A and 3B.

Target Neutralization and Evaluation

Growth inhibitory effects of IgY antibodies on £. faecalis were investigated. Whole cell £. faecalis bacteria were incubated with 15 mg/ml of ieY, and cfu analysis was performed after 24 h incubation. Treatment with 15 mg/ml IgY inhibited by >70% the growth of L. faecalis as visualized by reduction in the number of colonies on the agar plate. See Figure 4.

The growth inhibitory effect of IgY on F. faecalis was quantitated, and the percent imbibition was plotted. See Figure 3. Treatment of /. faecalis with anti-. faecalis+cytalsyin IgV antibody at 15 mg/ml concentration resulted in 73% inhibition of £. faecalis growth, indicating successful generation of neutralizing antibodies to /. faecalis.

Methods

Preparation of Eeg Powder for Preclinical Studies

Ege white and yolks were homogenized and freeze dried to create an egg powder. Ege powder was stored at 4°C. The freeze-dried egg powder was analyzed for antibody activity as described above in Example 1, and then evaluated in the humanized model of alcoholic liver disease (ALD) described below.
