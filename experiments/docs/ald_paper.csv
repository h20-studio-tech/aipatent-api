4caa28f42ec66b346172e2e3db7824b0,"Chronic liver disease due to alcohol-use disorder contributes markedly to the global burden of disease and mortality1–3. Alcoholic hepatitis is a severe and life-threatening form of alcohol-associated liver disease. The gut microbiota promotes ethanol- induced liver disease in mice4, but little is known about the microbial factors that are responsible for this process. Here we identify cytolysin—a two-subunit exotoxin that is secreted by Enterococcus faecalis5,6—as a cause of hepatocyte death and liver injury. Compared with non-alcoholic individuals or patients with alcohol-use disorder, patients with alcoholic hepatitis have increased faecal numbers of E. faecalis. The presence of cytolysin-positive (cytolytic) E. faecalis correlated with the severity of liver disease and with mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis.

The presence of cytolysin-positive (cytolytic) E. faecalis correlated with the severity of liver disease and with mortality in patients with alcoholic hepatitis. Using humanized mice that were colonized with bacteria from the faeces of patients with alcoholic hepatitis, we investigated the therapeutic effects of bacteriophages that target cytolytic E. faecalis. We found that these bacteriophages decrease cytolysin in the liver and abolish ethanol-induced liver disease in humanized mice.

f69623e70df04794c247d3a05995e5b6,"The most severe form of alcohol-related liver disease is alcoholic hepa- titis; mortality ranges from 20% to 40% at 1–6 months, and as many as 75% of patients die within 90 days of a diagnosis of severe alcoholic hepatitis7–9. Therapy with corticosteroids is only marginally effective9. Early liver transplantation is the only curative therapy, but is offered only at select centres and to a limited group of patients10.

Alcohol-related liver disease can be transmitted via faecal micro- biota4. We investigated the microorganisms and microbial factors that are responsible for this transmissible phenotype and for progression of alcohol-related liver disease.

When we isolated hepatocytes from ethanol-fed mice and then incubated these hepatocytes with ethanol, we did not observe increased levels of cytolysin-induced cell death compared to hepatocytes isolated from mice on the control diet, which indicates that cytolysin-induced hepatocyte cell death was independent of ethanol.

Data

Policy information about availability of data All manuscripts must include a data availability statement. This statement should provide the following information, where applicable:

Accession codes, unique identifiers, or web links for publicly available datasets - A list of figures that have associated raw data - A description of any restrictions on data availability

Raw 16S sequence reads can be found in the NCBI SRA associated with Bioproject PRJNA525701. Bacteriophage raw sequence reads and annotated genomes are

Life sciences study design

All studies must disclose on these points even when the disclosure is negative.

Sample size

No power analyses or other calculations were used to predetermine sample sizes. Sample sizes were chosen based on prior literature using similar experimental paradigms (Nat Commun. 2017;8:2137; Gut. 2019;68:1504-1515)

Data exclusions

No data were excluded

Replication",27,ald_paper,160
d2da610dd25a0725fba44fb85d27658d,"In vivo experiments: more than two technical replicates (from different cohorts, on different dates), as well as biological replicates were performed to ensure data reproducibility; In vitro experiments: three independent experiments and also replicates were performed on different dates to ensure data reproducibility. All replications were successful.

Randomization Mice of similar age and weight were randomly assigned to experimental and control groups.

Blinding

The investigators were not blinded during cell and animal experiment assays.
