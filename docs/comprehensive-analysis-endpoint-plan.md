# Comprehensive Analysis Endpoint - Implementation Plan

## Overview

The Comprehensive Analysis Endpoint will provide intelligent document analysis by leveraging LLaMA Parse for section extraction and Gemini API for content analysis.

## Proposed Architecture

**Flow**: Document Upload → LLaMA Parse (Section Extraction) → Gemini Analysis → Structured Response

## Implementation Steps

### 1. LLaMA Parse Integration Research
- Investigate LLaMA Parse API documentation and capabilities
- Understand section/subsection extraction formats
- Check authentication and rate limiting requirements

### 2. API Design
- Define request schema (document upload, analysis options)
- Design response schema for comprehensive analysis results
- Plan section-based analysis structure

### 3. Document Processing Pipeline
- Implement LLaMA Parse integration for section extraction
- Handle different document types and formats
- Structure extracted sections for analysis

### 4. AI Analysis Layer
- Set up Gemini API through OpenAI SDK
- Create analysis prompts for different section types
- Implement batch processing for multiple sections

### 5. FastAPI Endpoint Implementation
- Create `/api/v1/comprehensive-analysis/` endpoint
- Add request validation and file handling
- Integrate parsing and analysis pipeline

### 6. Error Handling & Validation
- Handle LLaMA Parse failures gracefully
- Manage API rate limits and timeouts
- Validate document formats and sizes

### 7. End-to-End Testing
- Test with various document types
- Verify analysis quality and completeness
- Performance testing for larger documents

## Questions for Alignment

1. What specific analysis should Gemini perform on each section?
2. Should we store analysis results or return them directly?
3. Any specific document format requirements beyond PDF?
4. Do you want real-time analysis or async processing for large documents?

## Technical Considerations

- Integration with existing FastAPI application structure
- Consistency with current error handling patterns
- Alignment with existing Pydantic models and schemas
- Compatibility with current async processing patterns
