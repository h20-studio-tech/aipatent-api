These antivenins, consisting of IgG or IgY antibodies, target four specific snakes: Cobra, common Krait, Russell’s viper, and Saw-scaled viper, with antibodies produced from hyper-immunized horse plasma or chicken eggs. The focus is on ensuring efficacy and safety of these antibody preparations for treatment use.",
